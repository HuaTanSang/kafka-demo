## 📄 Overview

This repository provides a simple Kafka streaming demo using **Docker Compose**. It includes:

- 📨 A **Kafka Producer** that reads and sends rows from a `data.csv` file (generated by `csv_generator.py`)

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- 🐳 Docker  
- 📦 Docker Compose  
- 🐧 Ubuntu 24.04.5 LTS (or compatible Linux distro)
